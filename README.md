This is a simple dump of my cheat sheet written for CIS 1600 (formerly CIS
160) at the University of Pennsylvania. The contents are written with respect
to the Fall 2021 iteration of the course, taught by Rajiv Gandhi.

By convention, every proven statement is preceeded by {L,HW,R}[0-14]{T,H}. This
denotes (lecture, homework, or recitation), followed by the week number, followed
by Tuesday or Thursday to disambiguate lectures and homeworks in the same week.

## Disclaimers

You're smart! So, you already know all of what I'm about to say here. Still,
I am obligated to repeat:

CIS 160(0) is painful. This cheatsheet will not make the pain go away!
Reading this document will not magically absorb the information into your
brain. As a resource, I would only recommend using this cheatsheet as:

1. A curiosity to be admired from afar if you are not enrolled in CIS 160(0)

2. An outline of the course contents to consider when building your own
   study plan

> **_NOTE:_** Even this is a little sketchy. Short of people like you
> maintaining it, it is entirely possible and expected for the course
> contents to have evolved between when I took the course and when
> you are now.

3. A reference to use while completing homework assignments
   to recall what has already been proven in lecture (and therefore
   can be invoked without proof)

## Contributing

If you find a gap in a more recent iteration of the course or find
some kind of mistake in the cheatsheet, feel free to submit an
issue pointing it out or, even better, a pull request correcting it!

I have no plan to perform any maintenance on the cheatsheet, but
I'll be more than happy to review pull requests and grant repo
privileges to any enthusiastic young CIS 160(0) scholars who would
like to do a lot of maintenance.
